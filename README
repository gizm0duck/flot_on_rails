FlotOnRails
===========

Flot is a powerful charting library for jQuery, and flot_on_rails aims to 
package it up into a nice, easy to use Ruby interface.  Flotilla is another
library that aims to do the same thing, but I found it a little confusing
and there was no test coverage.  After hacking around on it for a bit, trying
to make it fit my needs I decided to roll my own instead.

Installation
=======

You will need jquery, flot, and excanvas javascript files in order for Flot
to function.  If you install by using script/plugin install, then these files
should already be copied into your public/javascripts directory.  If you
install it any other way, you can run the following rake task:

rake flot_on_rails:initialize

Which will copy the files to your javascript directory

Example
=======

The chart will likely be accessed through the 'flot_chart' view helper method.


You can find some more information by looking at the spec files.
